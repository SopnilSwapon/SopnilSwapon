My name is Md. Sapon Mia, a dedicated individual with a fervent passion for software engineering. Despite my unconventional background in Chemistry, I have immersed myself deeply in learning and mastering HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JavaScript, and ReactJS. Additionally, I have practical experience with NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB, particularly in CRUD operations.

My journey in software engineering is driven by continuous exploration and the pursuit of mastery in these languages and frameworks. Committed to ongoing growth and contribution, I am eager to transition into a career where I can make meaningful strides in this dynamic field.

**Skills:** REACT / JS / NodeJS / ExpressJS / MongoDB / Tailwind / HTML / CSS / React Hook Form / Tanstack Query
